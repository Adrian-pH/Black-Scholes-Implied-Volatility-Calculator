This project uses the Black-Scholes European call option preice and vega values along with teh Newton -Raphson method to calculate and visulaise the implied volatility's value over time and the underlying's price.
I wrote this as a mini-project on the content taught in Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance Chapter 8.
